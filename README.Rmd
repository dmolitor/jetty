> Execute R functions or code blocks within a Docker container.

It may be useful, in certain circumstances, to perform a computation in a 
separate R process that is running within a Docker container. This package
attempts to achieve this!

## Features

- Calls an R function with arguments or a code block in a subprocess 
within a Docker container.

- Copies function arguments (as necessary) to the subprocess and copies the 
return value of the function/code block.

- Discovers and installs required packages in the Docker container at run-time.

- Copies error objects back from the subprocess. In general, these error objects
do not include the stack trace from the Docker R process. However, if for example
the error is an rlang error, it will include the full stack trace.

- Shows and/or collects the standard output and standard error of the Docker
subprocess.

## Install

To install jetty from GitHub:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("dmolitor/jetty")
```

## Synchronous, one-off R processes in a Docker container

Use `run()` to execute an R function or code block in a new R process within a
Docker container. The results are passed back directly to the local R session.

```{r}
jetty::run(function() var(iris[, 1:4]))
```

### Specifying Docker container

The desired Docker container can be set via the `image` argument, and should be
specified as a string in standard Docker format. These formats include
`username/image:tag`, `username/image`, `image:tag`, and `image`. The default
choice is `r-base:{jetty:::r_version()}` which is a bare-bones R image that mirrors
the R version running locally. For example, the following command would be
executed in the official [`r-base`](https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base)
image with the latest version of R, which comes with no packages beyond the
base set installed:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jetty::run(function() var(iris[, 1:4]), image = "r-base:latest")
```

### Passing arguments

You can pass arguments to the function by setting `args` to the list of
arguments, similar to the base `do.call` function. This is often necessary, as
the function being evaluated in the Docker R process does not have access to
variables in the parent process. For example, the following does not work:
```{r, error = TRUE}
mycars <- cars
jetty::run(function() summary(mycars))
```

But this does:
```{r}
mycars <- cars
jetty::run(function(x) summary(x), args = list(mycars))
```

### Using packages

You can use any package in the child R process, with the caveat that the
package must be installed in the Docker container. While it's recommended to
refer to it explicitly with the `::` operator, the code snippet can also call
`library()` or `require()` and will work fine. For example, the following code
snippets both work equally well:

```{r}
jetty::run(
  {
    library(Matrix);
    function(nrow, ncol) rsparsematrix(nrow, ncol, density = 1)
  },
  args = list(nrow = 10, ncol = 2)
)
```

and
```{r}
jetty::run(
  function(nrow, ncol) Matrix::rsparsematrix(nrow, ncol, density = 1),
  args = list(nrow = 10, ncol = 2)
)
```

#### Installing required packages

jetty also supports installing required packages at runtime. For example,
the following code will fail because the required packages are not installed
in the Docker image:
```{r, error = TRUE}
jetty::run(
  {
    ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, ggplot2::aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
      ggplot2::geom_point()
  }
)
```

However, by setting `install_dependencies = TRUE` we can tell jetty to discover
the required packages and install them before executing the code:
```{r}
jetty::run(
  {
    ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, ggplot2::aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
      ggplot2::geom_point()
  },
  install_dependencies = TRUE,
  stdout = TRUE
)
```

**Note**: this feature uses [`renv::dependencies`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/dependencies.html)
to discover the required packages, and won't handle all possible scenarios.
In particular, it won't install specific package versions (just the latest version)
and it will only install packages that are on CRAN. Use this with care!

### Error handling

jetty copies errors from the child R process to the main R session:

```{r, error = TRUE}
jetty::run(function() 1 + "A")
```

Although the errors themselves are propagated to the main R session, the stack
trace is (currently) not propagated. This means that calling functions such as
`traceback()` and `rlang::last_trace()` won't be of any help.

### Standard output and error

By default, the standard output and error of the Docker subprocess are printed
to the R console. However, since jetty uses `system2()` to execute all Docker
commands, you can specify the `stdout` and `stderr` arguments which will
be passed directly to `system2()`. For example the following code will print
a series of messages to the console:
```{r, eval = FALSE, message = TRUE}
jetty::run({for (i in 1:5) message(paste0("iter", i)); TRUE})
#> iter1
#> iter2
#> iter3
#> iter4
#> iter5
#> [1] TRUE
```

But you can discard this output by setting `stdout = FALSE`:
```{r, eval = FALSE, message = TRUE}
jetty::run({for (i in 1:5) message(paste0("iter", i)); TRUE}, stdout = FALSE)
#> [1] TRUE
```

To see more details on controlling `stdout` and `stderr`, check out the
[documentation here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/system2.html).

### .Rprofile and .Renviron

jetty also provides some support for `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` files. By
default, jetty will search for files called ".Rprofile" and ".Renviron" in
the current working directory. If these files exist, jetty will port them
to the Docker execution environment and will execute any code in `.Rprofile`
and load all environment variables in `.Renviron` before executing the provided
R code. If the `.Rprofile` file uses external packages, it is
essential to tell jetty to install required packages (as described above)
otherwise the code will fail.

The user can explicitly provide `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` file paths via the
`r_profile` and `r_environ` arguments. For example, the following code will
attach the `.Rprofile` found in the `/man/scaffolding/` sub-directory of the
current working directory. This file simply uses the
[praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise) package to provide some
encouragement at the start of a new R session.
```{r, eval = FALSE, message = TRUE}
four <- jetty::run(
  \() 2 + 2,
  r_profile = here::here("man/scaffolding/.Rprofile"),
  install_dependencies = TRUE
)
#> Installing package into ‘/usr/local/lib/R/site-library’
#> (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
#> trying URL 'https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/source/linux-gnu/aarch64/src/contrib/../../../../../linux/aarch64/pak_0.8.0_R-4-4_aarch64-linux.tar.gz'
#> Content type 'application/gzip' length 8847947 bytes (8.4 MB)
#> ==================================================

#>

#> * DONE (pak)
#> 
#> The downloaded source packages are in

#> ✔ Installed praise 1.0.0  (7ms)
#> ✔ 1 pkg: added 1, dld 1 (6.10 kB) [3.8s]
#> You are exquisite!
```

However, as noted above, this fails if `install_dependencies = FALSE`.
```{r, error = TRUE}
four <- jetty::run(
  \() 2 + 2,
  r_profile = here::here("man/scaffolding/.Rprofile")
)
```

#### Multiple .Rprofile or .Renviron files

Currently jetty only supports single `.Rprofile` or `.Renviron` files. So,
for example, if a user has a project-specific .Rprofile in the current
working directory at `./.Rprofile` and then a user-specific .Rprofile at
`~/.Rprofile`, jetty will only source `./.Rprofile` and will ignore
`~/.Rprofile`. This is a feature I plan to add before long.
