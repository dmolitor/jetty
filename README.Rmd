> Execute R functions or code blocks within a Docker container.

It may be useful, in certain circumstances, to perform a computation in a 
separate R process that is running within a Docker container. This package
attempts to achieve this!

## Features

- [x] Call an R function with arguments or a code block in a subprocess 
within a Docker container

- [x] Copies function arguments (as necessary) to the subprocess and copies the 
return value of the function/code block

- [x] Copies error objects back from the subprocess.

- [ ] Error objects include stack trace.

- [x] Shows the standard error and (to some degree) standard output of the subprocess. 

- [ ] Collects the standard output and standard error.

- [ ] Call the function/code block asynchronously (in the background)

- [ ] Supports persistent R/Docker subprocesses.

## Install

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dmolitor/jetty")
```

## Usage

Use `run()` to execute an R function or code block in a new R process within a
Docker container. The results are passed back directly to the local R session.

```{r}
jetty::run(function() summary(cars))
```

### Specifying Docker container

The desired Docker container can be set via the `image` argument, and should be
specified as a string in standard Docker format. These formats include
`username/image:tag`, `usename/image`, `image:tag`, and `image`. The default
choice is `r-base:{local R version}` which is a bare-bones R image that mirrors
the R version running locally. For example, the following command would be
executed in the
[`rocker/tidyverse`](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html)
image, which comes with the tidyverse (among others) already installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
jetty::run(function() summary(cars), image = "rocker/tidyverse")
```

### Passing arguments

You can pass arguments to the function by setting `args` to the list of
arguments, similar to the base `do.call` function.

Note that the function being evaluated in `jetty::run` does not have access to
variables in the parent process. If the function relies on specific variables,
they must be passed in via `args`. For example, the following does not work:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mycars <- cars
jetty::run(function() summary(mycars))
```

But this does:

```{r}
mycars <- cars
jetty::run(function(x) summary(x), args = list(mycars))
```

### Using packages

You can use any package in the child R process, with the major caveat that the
package must be installed in the Docker container. While it's recommended to
refer to it explicitly with the `::` operator, the code snippet can also call
`library()` or `require()` and will work fine. For example, the following code
snippets should be identical:

```{r}
jetty::run(
  {
    library(Matrix);
    function(nrow, ncol) rsparsematrix(nrow, ncol, density = 1)
  },
  args = list(nrow = 10, ncol = 2)
)
```

and

```{r}
jetty::run(
  function(nrow, ncol) Matrix::rsparsematrix(nrow, ncol, density = 1),
  args = list(nrow = 10, ncol = 2)
)
```

### Error handling

jetty copies errors from the child R process to the main R session:

```{r, error=TRUE}
jetty::run(function() 1 + "A")
```

Although the errors themselves are propagated to the main R session, the stack
trace is (currently) not propagated. This means that calling functions such as
`traceback()` and `rlang::last_trace()` won't be of any help.

### Standard output and error

This is a little weird at the moment. All messages and warnings currently
surface, but printed output doesn't show up. Still under construction...

```{r, include=FALSE}
jetty::run(invisible(for (i in 1:5) message("iter", i, "\n")))
```

Currently, jetty won't capture the standard error/output and direct it
anywhere.

## Where it's headed

Maybe nowhere? This is still a relatively rough-shod implementation, and it's
not totally clear to me what use-case it fills. However, it _feels_ like it
should be useful somehow.
