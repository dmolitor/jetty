Title: Execute R in a 'Docker' Context
Version: 0.2.2

Description: The goal of 'jetty' is to execute R functions and code
    snippets in an isolated R subprocess within a 'Docker' container
    and return the evaluated results to the local R session. 'jetty'
    can install necessary packages at runtime and seamlessly propagates
    errors and outputs from the 'Docker' subprocess back to the main
    session. 'jetty' is primarily designed for sandboxed testing and
    quick execution of example code.
